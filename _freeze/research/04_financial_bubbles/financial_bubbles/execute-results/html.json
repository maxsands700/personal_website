The Dot-Com bubble in 2001, the Great Financial Crisis in 2008, and the Tech bubble in 2022 are three examples. In each case, the period leading up to, during, and after the bubble's collapse brought varying degrees of market volatility and returns. Investors who exited before the crash were able to achieve impressive returns, while those who remained in the market experienced significant losses. As such, it is valuable for investors to be able to identify where financial bubbles are forming and their stage of development to avoid potential losses.\n\nIn his book [*Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises*](https://www.bridgewater.com/big-debt-crises/principles-for-navigating-big-debt-crises-by-ray-dalio.pdf), Ray Dalio posits that markets are cyclical and that financial bubbles form for the same underlying reasons; he outlines the following rough framework for identifying financial bubbles with the associated message:\n\n![](financial_framework.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n> *At this point I want to emphasize that it is a mistake to think that any one metric can serve as an indicator of an impending debt crisis. The ratio of debt to income for the economy as a whole, or even debt service payments to income for the economy as a whole, which is better, are useful but ultimately inadequate measures. To anticipate a debt crisis well, one has to look at the specific debt-service abilities of the individual entities, which are lost in these averages. More specifically, a high level of debt or debt service to income is less problematic if the average is well distributed across the economy than if it is concentrated --- especially if it is concentrated in key entities.*\n>\n> *- Ray Dalio*\n\nWhile the above framework is tailored for large-scale economic bubbles that drastically affected national economies, we will extend, adapt, and apply this framework to create a `Grand Financial Bubble Metric` and identify financial bubbles within various sectors of the U.S. economy and markets.\n\n<hr>\n\n## Methods for Quantifying the Framework\n\nThe following table outlines certain figures that can help us measure each component of Dalio's Rubric:\n\n+-----------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Framework Component                                       | Ways to Quantify                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n+===========================================================+===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================+\n| *Are prices high relative to traditional measures?*       | 1.

Assessing hypothetical interest coverage ratios if interest rates increase will likely help answer this question. |\n+-----------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nGoing forward, we will only consider the following framework components, as I believe they best encapsulate the underpinnings of the framework and are simultaneously easy to quantify:\n\n1.  Are prices high relative to traditional measures?\n\n2.  Are purchases being financed w/ high leverage?\n\n3.  Have new participants entered the market?\n\n4.  Does tightening risk popping the bubble?*\\**\n\n::: column-margin\n\\*We will qualitatively consider this section of the framework after building our `Grand Financial Bubble Metric`\n:::\n\n<hr>\n\n## The Data\n\nIn order to do this, I have collected:\n\n-   Key figures from the Income Statements, Balance Sheets, and Cash Flow Statements of all the companies in the Russell 3000 Index since 1996, including the sector classification of each company\n\n-   Global IPO data since 1993\n\n-   Economic Data (GDP, Federal Funds Rate, etc.)\n\nHere is a glimpse of each

framework with the data available to us:\n\n<hr>\n\n### 1) Prices are High Relative to Traditional Measures\n\nLet's take a look at the historical P/S, P/B, and P/E ratios of each sector. To do this, we will plot the median value of these ratios since 1995 for different sectors while also aggregating by company size according to the following schema:\n\n+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------+\n| Small Cap       | Market Cap between 0th-40th Percentile for its Sector   |\n+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------+\n| Mid Cap         | Market Cap between 40th-80th Percentile for its Sector  |\n+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------+\n| Large Cap       | Market Cap between 80th-95th Percentile for its Sector  |\n+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------+\n| Ultra-Large Cap | Market Cap between 95th-100th Percentile for its Sector |\n+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------+\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### Price-to-Sales\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Dashed line represents median of medians for *Large Cap* bucket](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Price-to-Book\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Dashed line represents median of medians for *Large Cap* bucket](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Price-to-Earnings\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Dashed line represents median of medians for *Large Cap* bucket](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nThe above is overwhelming, but it does paint the general picture that financial bubbles have formed when prices are high relative to traditional measures. For instance, the Dot-Com Bubble of '00/'01 is seen most uniformly in the above with high price ratios across the board.\n\nHowever, let's try to represent the data in a more concise and standardized fashion.\n\n#### Creating a Price Metric\n\nLet's create a standard `Price Metric` by:\n\n1.  Calculating the distance of each of these ratios from a median line\n2.  Dividing this distance by the average absolute distance from the median line\n3.  Averaging the standardized distances for the P/S, P/B, & P/E ratios together to a create a single `Price Metric`\n\nBy doing this we will have a rough estimation of how elevated prices are for each of these sectors and market cap buckets.\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##### Takeaways:\n\nFrom eye-balling the above charts we can conclude that the following sectors were highly priced relative to traditional measures:\n\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Sector                 | Time Periods                      |\n+========================+===================================+\n| Communications         | '99 - '01, '20 - '22              |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Consumer Discretionary | '20 - '22                         |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Consumer Staples       | '97 - '02, '22                    |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Energy                 | '00, '17 - '18                    |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Financials             | '98 - '02, '18                    |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Health Care            | '98-'02, '20 - '22                |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Industrials            | '20 - '22                         |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Materials              | '20 - '22                         |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Real Estate            | '19 - '22                         |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Technology             | '99 - '02, '20 - '23              |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Utilities              | '01, '07, '18 - '23               |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n\nAs we continue through our framework, we will see if the same time periods resurface.\n\n#### Digging Deeper\n\nNow that we have time periods in which certain broad sectors were highly priced, we can repeat the above at a more granular level. This is important since large values can be washed away in averages when aggregating at broader hierarchical sector levels. For instance, we could have a high price metric of +3 for *Semiconductors* and a low metric of -3 for *Software*; if these were the only two sub-sectors in the *Technology* space, then the price metric for *Technology* would likely lie around 0. This scenario is much different from one wherein both *Semiconductors* and *Software* have price metrics of 0, which would also consequently yield a price metric of around 0 for *Technology*.\n\nIn the following, we consider only *Large Cap* and *Ultra-Large Cap* as there are fewer companies in each bucket when aggregating at a more granular sector level:\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n##  Health Care \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Materials \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-2.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Industrials \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-3.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Consumer Discretionary \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-4.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Technology \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-5.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Real Estate \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-6.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Financials \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-7.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Communications \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-8.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Energy \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-9.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Consumer Staples \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-10.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Utilities \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-11.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n:::\n\n<hr>\n\n### 2) Purchases are Being Financed w/ High Leverage\n\nLet's take a look at the historical debt levels of each sector since 1995. Once again, we will aggregate by company size and plot the median value for different sectors. In this section we will consider two metrics to assess debt levels:\n\n$$\nMetric_1 =  \\frac{D_t}{E_t} = \\frac{LT\\ Debt_t + ST\\ Debt_t}{Equity_t}\n$$\n\n$$\nMetric_2 = \\frac{Avg\\ Debt_t}{GDP_t} = \\frac{(\\frac{\\sum{LT\\ Debt_t + ST\\ Debt_t}}{No.\\ of\\ Companies_t})}{GDP_t}\n$$\n\nThe first metric aims to represent leverage at the company level, whereas the second metric aims to represent the significance of that debt in relation to the size of the general economy.\n\nIn the second metric, we consider the *average* debt level as a ratio to GDP because the number of companies within each sector of the Russell 3000 varies each year. Therefore, simply calculating the sum for each year could overstate debt levels for years in which there are more companies than usual. Instead, we hope to measure this in isolation in the section *`3) New entrants are entering the market`*.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### Metric 1\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Metric 2\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nWhile the data is not crystal clear, the above generally corroborates the idea that financial bubbles have formed during times of increased leverage. Again, let's try to represent the data in a more concise and standard fashion.\n\n#### Creating a Debt Metric\n\nLet's create a standard `Debt Metric` by:\n\n1.  Calculating the distance of each of these ratios from a median line\n2.  Dividing this distance by the average absolute distance from the median line\n3.  Averaging the standardized distances for Metric 1 & Metric 2 with the respective weights of 90% and 10%*\\**\n\n::: column-margin\n*\\*Metric 1 is more stationary and cyclical; therefore, we are giving it a greater weight as it will be more reliable when measuring absolute debt levels.*\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##### Takeaways:\n\nLet's repeat our process and identify time periods where debt levels were high in each sector:\n\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Sector                 | Time Periods                      |\n+========================+===================================+\n| Communications         | '97 - '99, '02, '10, '18 - '21    |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Consumer Discretionary | '18, '20-'22                      |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Consumer Staples       |                                   |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Energy                 | '01, '03, '19 - '22               |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Financials             | '01 - '09                         |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Health Care            | '18 - '23                         |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Industrials            | '09, '19-'23                      |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Materials              | '01 - '03, '15, '21               |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Real Estate            | '08-'10                           |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Technology             | '18 - '23                         |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n| Utilities              | '03 - '05, '18 - '23              |\n+------------------------+-----------------------------------+\n\n#### Digging Deeper\n\nOnce again, we can take a more granular look at the data:\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n##  Health Care \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Materials \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-2.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Industrials \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-3.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Consumer Discretionary \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-4.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Technology \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-5.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Real Estate \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-6.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Financials \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-7.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Communications \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-8.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Energy \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-9.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Consumer Staples \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-10.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Utilities \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-11.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n:::\n\n<hr>\n\n### 3) New Entrants to the Market\n\nThere are several ways that we can assess whether new players are entering markets. The most direct and simple method is to track when private companies become public (i.e. IPO data). Let's track IPO activity by:\n\n1.  Counting the \\# of IPOs each month\n2.

We notice that the count of monthly IPOs is somewhat cyclical with peaks before time periods typically associated with financial bubbles ('01, '08, '22).\n\n#### Creating an IPO Metric\n\nLet's create a standard `IPO Metric` by:\n\n1.  Calculating the distance between a 3-month rolling average and a 4-year rolling average of IPO Count & Avg. Offer Size\n2.  Calculating a standardized distance for both of these rolling averages\n3.  Averaging the standardized distances together to a create a single `IPO Metric`\n\nBy doing this we will have a rough estimation of how 'hot' markets are and if the number of entrants is high relative to historical averages:\n\n::: panel-tabset\n#### Aggregate\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png){width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Sector-Level\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n<hr>\n\n#### Digging Deeper\n\nOnce again, let's take a more granular look at the data:\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n##  Health Care \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Materials \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-2.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Industrials \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-3.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Consumer Discretionary \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-4.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Technology \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-5.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Real Estate \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-6.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Financials \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-7.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Communications \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-8.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Energy \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-9.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Consumer Staples \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-10.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Utilities \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-11.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n:::\n\nFrom observing the above at Sector Level 3, we notice that the IPO metric behaves oddly for several segments. This odd behavior is the result of limited IPO data for those segments and we will have to address this when creating our grand summary `Financial Bubble Metric`.\n\n## Putting It All Together\n\nLet's take each of our metrics, scale them to values between 0 and 1, and average them together to create a `Grand Financial Bubble Metric`. We will then re-scale our resulting metric between 0 and 1.\n\nIt is important to note that our IPO metric can take on extreme values at the sector level - *Health Care* in 2001 and *Financials* (w/ the SPAC surge) in 2021. Because these extreme points reduce the relative importance of other time periods, we will water them down and keep this in the back of our minds going forward.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAt this point, I will caution the reader that I would associate any inferences taken from our `Grand Financial Bubble Metric` should be taken with reservation. The metric allows for a good basic framing of where sectors are relative to history, but understanding the key dynamics at play within each sector, and the current macroeconomic environment is equally as important.\n\nWith that said, we can see that our `Grand Financial Bubble Metric` may be helpful in determining sector performance. In general, we observe positive returns when the metric is relatively low and increasing. As the market frenzies and there are new competitors, higher valuations, and debt-financed growth, market returns are particularly strong. Eventually, our metric peaks, and subsequent returns are generally poor.\n\nThere are a few things worth noting from our plot:\n\n1.  Our confidence in the metric varies for different market segments\n    i.  For instance, our metric is particularly informative for the *Energy*, *Technology*, and *Consumer* segments, but it is difficult to decipher for the *Real Estate* segment. This is likely due to the fact that we have seen several cycles in the former segments, but not in the latter.\n2.  Our metric indicated potential bubbles in '00 and '22, but completely missed the mark in 2008.\n    i.  `Explain this…`\n3.  Our metric provides a framework for historical comparison, but it does not provide a time-based trading signal (and it should not be looked at *in isolation* when making investment decisions). For instance, if we were to look at our plot in 2018, it would have been very reasonable to conjecture that *Technology* was in a bubble and poised for poor investment returns in the coming years. Yet, '19 - '21 were extremely strong years for that industry, and the bubble did not pop until 2022. *Why is that & what are the main catalysts that cause the bubble to pop?*\n    i.  *We will discuss this shortly...*\n4.  The effects of bubbles in a particular segment tend to affect other segments as well, even if they appear unrelated, with varying degrees of magnitude.\n\nLet's create our `Grand Financial Bubble Metric` at a more granular level. We are only going to include the sectors that have sufficient data. For those with sufficient Price & Debt data, but insufficient IPO data, we will calculate our `Grand Financial Bubble Metric` as the average of `Price Metric` and `Debt Metric` and exclude the `IPO Metric`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n##  Communications \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Industrials \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-2.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Consumer Discretionary \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-3.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Financials \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-4.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Consumer Staples \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-5.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Health Care \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-6.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Materials \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-7.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Energy \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-8.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Real Estate \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-9.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n\n\n##  Technology \n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-10.png){width=1152}\n:::\n\n:::\n\n`Get constituent price data and overlay color scale returns for each Sector Level 3...`\n\n### 'Timing' the Bubble\n\nThe ability to time market bubbles is nearly impossible, but the main indicators that many people pay attention to are interest rates/measures of borrowing cost. Since a large part of bubbles are caused by debt, it is logical that the cost of borrowing money is highly relevant.\n\nOne of the most observed interest rate metrics in the industry is the \"10-2\" Yield Spread which measures the difference in the yield of a 10-year Treasury Bond and that of a 2-year Treasury bond. Before we plot this measure below, I think it is important to understand the significance of this metric and its implications. Let's consider two scenarios:\n\n1.  A 10-year TBond is yielding 7% per year, and a 2-year TBond is yielding 3% per year, thus netting out to a 4% spread.\n    i.  This scenario implies that the average person demands 4% more of a return on their investment to loan out their money for 10 years, rather than 2 years. At the most basic level, this is logical. The overarching rationale for this can be boiled down to *General Uncertainty about the Future:* the longer that maturity of the bond, the more time there is for unexpected events to occur that may affect the bond's value, or the buyer's perceived value of the bond, and therefore lenders demand higher rates of return for this increased uncertainty. Economists have outlined key risks attributable to this uncertainty:\n\n        a.  *Future Inflation Expectations/Inflation Risk*: When investors expect higher inflation in the future, they demand higher yields to compensate for the loss of purchasing power. The longer the maturity of the bond, the more sensitive it is to the inflation expectations, which results in higher yields.\n\n        b.  *Credit Risk*: Generally, longer-term bonds have a higher credit risk than shorter-term bonds. This is because the longer the maturity of the bond, the more time there is for the borrower's creditworthiness to change. If investors perceive that there is a higher risk that the issuer may default on the bond, they will demand a higher yield on longer-term bonds to compensate for this credit risk.\n\n        c.  *Liquidity Risk*: Bonds with varying maturities may have various degrees of ease in which they can be bought or sold without affecting its price. This can be due to a lack of market participants, sudden increases or decreases in supply and demand, etc.\n2.  A 10-year TBond is yielding 3% per year, and a 2-year TBond is yielding 2% per year, thus netting out to a -1% spread. When this spread is negative, it is called a yield curve inversion.\n    i.  This scenario implies that the average person is willing to *give up a 1%* return on their investment to loan out their money for an additional 8 years. In other words, lenders are *more uncertain about the near-term than the long-term* (for any of the aforementioned reasons)!\n\nIf market consensus indicates greater uncertainty regarding the short-term, as it does in the second scenario, this does not bode well for the economy and markets. Therefore, it is likely that the \"10-2\" Yield Spread is an insightful metric for our purposes.\n\nMany people, rightfully so, will push back and repeat the famous adage \"yield-curve inversions predict 4 out of every 3 recessions,\" and they are right; it is impossible to predict markets with the use of solely one metric, and there are times when the yield-curve has inverted and markets rallied. This is normal, there are absolutely times when the short-term is uncertain, but the underlying foundation of markets are structurally sound, and therefore the future still holds prospect for healthy growth. However, I believe studying yield curve inversions *in conjunction* with our `Grand Financial Bubble Metric` allows for powerful insights - if markets are uncertain about the near-term ***and*** markets are structurally unsound, or have been growing beyond potential, then it is likely that future growth prospects are weak.\n\nWith that said, let's inspect interest rates and the \"10-2\" Yield spread:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we can see from our plots, real equity returns tend to be negative following yield curve inversions. We can also see that the Fed, when possible, drops interest rates to stimulate the economy. However, we notice that it cannot afford to do so when a) inflation is out of control and/or b) when rates are already at 0%.\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](financial_bubbles_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##### Final Remarks\n\n*The above is intended as an exploration of historical data, and all statements and opinions are expressly my own; neither should be construed as investment advice.*\n",
