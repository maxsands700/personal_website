Various empirical studies have demonstrated that these portfolios tend to yield returns that surpass those of the average retail investor. The precise factors contributing to this outperformance remain a subject of ongoing investigation and debate.\n\nA pioneering study conducted by Alan J. Ziobrowski and his team in 2004 found that U.S. Senators' stock portfolios surpassed market returns by an impressive 12% annually. In 2011, Ziobrowski expanded this line of investigation to members of the U.S. House of Representatives, whose portfolios were observed to outperform market returns by approximately 6% annually[^1].\n\n[^1]: [The Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis - Vol. 39, No. 4 (Dec., 2004), pp. 661-676 (16 pages)](files/Abnormal_Returns_From_the_Common_Stock_Investments.pdf)\n\nWhile these studies did not directly attribute such investment outperformance to the use of insider information, the consistent pattern of superior returns does raise questions about the sources of information and analysis guiding these investment decisions.\n\nSubsequent to these studies, the passage of the STOCK (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge) Act in 2012 sought to curtail potential misuse of nonpublic information by explicitly prohibiting members of Congress from engaging in stock trading based on such data. The effectiveness of this legislative measure, however, remains difficult to evaluate due to inherent challenges in determining the precise basis of investment decisions.\n\nAt a first glance, it appears that the STOCK Act of 2012 has had limited success in mitigating the abnormal returns generated in the portfolios of these politicians. [Quiver Quant](https://www.quiverquant.com/), a platform designed by 2 college students with the goal of providing alternative data-sets to retail investors, created a portfolio to measure just this:\n\n![](images/Congress_Portfolio.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"3066\"}\n\nAs we can see, the back tested Quiver portfolio yielded a CAGR of 43.69% since 2020-04-01, whereas the market experienced a CAGR of approximately 11% during this time period. This 32% difference seems rather large, especially when compared to the findings provided by Ziobrowski and his team. Because of this, we will explore the current state of this phenomena, scrutinizing available data, and evaluating whether the investment outperformance trend among U.S. politicians persists to this day. We will analyze the implications of these patterns, probe the role of legislation such as the STOCK Act, and examine the potential factors contributing to the superior returns exhibited by this unique class of investors.\n\n#### The Data\n\nBelow is a glimpse of the data, scraped from regulatory filings and provided by [House Stock Watcher](https://housestockwatcher.com/) & [Senate Stock Watcher](https://senatestockwatcher.com/):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 9,240\nColumns: 10\n$ transaction_date    <date> 2021-09-27, 2021-09-13, 2021-09-10, 2021-09-28, 2…\n$ disclosure_date     <date> 2021-10-04, 2021-10-04, 2021-10-04, 2021-10-04, 2…\n$ days_late           <dbl> 7, 21, 24, 6, 7, 7, 20, 25, 26, 29, 8, 7, 25, 18, …\n$ representative      <chr> \"Virginia Foxx\", \"Virginia Foxx\", \"Virginia Foxx\",…\n$ representative_type <chr> \"Congress Member\", \"Congress Member\", \"Congress Me…\n$ party               <chr> \"Republican\", \"Republican\", \"Republican\", \"Republi…\n$ state               <chr> \"NC\", \"NC\", \"NC\", \"NC\", \"NY\", \"NY\", \"NC\", \"NC\", \"N…\n$ owner               <chr> \"Joint\", \"Joint\", \"Joint\", \"Joint\", \"Unknown\", \"Un…\n$ amount              <fct> \"$1,001 - $15,000\", \"$1,001 - $15,000\", \"$15,001 -…\n$ stock_performance   <list> [<tbl_df[86 x 6]>], [<tbl_df[87 x 6]>], [<tbl_df[…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<hr>\n\n# Analysis\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](politicians_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
