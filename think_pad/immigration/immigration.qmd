Prior to diving into the facts and statistics around U.S. immigration policy, I will take a first principles approach at outlining what I deem as an effective immigration policy. After this thought experiment, I will delve into the current state of U.S. immigration and immigration policy and compare them to those of other countries.

# First Principles

Running a government is analogous to running a household, albeit on a much larger scale. As such, let's imagine how we would want immigration to play out in our household microcosm...

Let's imagine we live on a large, gated property, and there is a line of people at the front gates, asking to live on our property. Here are the factors I would consider when deciding if these people can live on our property:

#### Admittance Criteria

1.  **Ethos Alignment** - does the additional inhabitant's values and ethos align with those of the broader household?
2.  **Financial Capacity** - can the household financially support the additional inhabitant and what is the inhabitants net benefit to our property?
3.  **Spatial Capacity** - is there enough room for the additional inhabitant?

#### Prerequisite Information

Given our criteria, in order for us to make an informed admittance decision, we need to be informed of:

1.  Our household's current spatial and financial situation, as well as our extant ethos.
2.  The potential inhabitant's 'financial situation' and ethos.

## Thought Experiment - Building out the Analogy

### 1. Ethos Alignment

Out of self-interest and the well-being of my property and its current inhabitants, I would **only** want to **admit immigrants that embody the household ethos**. Therefore, applicants with a recent history of violence, crime, or any other conduct that violates the household ethos should always be rejected.

### 2. Financial Capacity

In the ***majority*** **of cases, an applicant** should **only be admitted if they provide a net benefit to the household**. Let's imagine that next in line at our front gates is a farmer. Our perceived value of the farmer depends on the mismatch of supply and demand for farming skills in our household. If our household is short-staffed for farmers, then the marginal benefit of an additional farmer is large. On the other hand, if there is no supply-demand mismatch for farming skills in our household, then the benefit of an additional farmer is negligible.

Moreover, let's imagine that, after assessing our current supply-demand gap, we agree that an additional farmer is beneficial for our household. If we then place our farmer in the *mechanic's* quarters with no mode of transportation to the crop fields, the value of the additional farmer is rendered null.

While this is an overly simple analogy, it demonstrates that **an entrant's benefit to society is dependent on:**

1.  **The supply-demand mismatch for that entrant's skills**
2.  **The entrant's environment**

Our analogy also crucially demonstrates that **in order for any immigration policy to be effective, it must be able to allocate human capital efficiently**. As such, the **household must always be aware of the supply-demand mismatch in localized environments**, and **have the ability to transport the entrant** to the environment.

There are a ***minority*** **of cases** where an **applicant should be admitted, even if they do not provide a net benefit** to the household. Applicants seeking **asylum or refuge** from an abusive household should be allowed entry, **granted that** they **adhere to the household's ethos**, and the **household has sufficient financial capacity to shelter them**. However, it is unlikely that a household could harbor all refugees at any point in time. Therefore, it is likely that a quota would be necessary; the quota should be a function of current and projected profitability of the household.

### 3. Spatial Capacity

Lastly, an applicant can only be admitted if there is enough space for the applicant in his designated environment.

## Basic Decision Map

    A[Potential Inhabitant applies for entry] --> B(Applicant demonstrates Ethos alignment);

```

## Thought Experiment Notes

#### Purpose

The purpose of the Household thought experiment is to establish a basic, universal framework for assessing whether an immigrant should be granted admission into a country. It does not dive into the specifics of how these criteria should be calculated; it does not discuss the merits of possible tenants for a nation's ethos, nor does it explicitly provide a method for assessing an individual's benefit to society, etc. Obviously, these topics are more subjective and deserve their own research. However, the specifics of these criteria do not detract from the importance of the core framework.

#### Assumptions

Our thought experiment and framework make two important implicit assumptions.

1.  Our household has a **controlled** border.
    i.  Without a controlled border, the entire thought experiment and framework is rendered void.
2.  Our household has the ability to transport admittees to their designated environment.

#### Interesting Tangents

In thinking through our analogy, it is clear that the alignment between individual ethos and societal ethos is critical. Therefore, there should exist an institution specifically devoted to the reform of individuals with a misaligned ethos. After a proper and reasonable attempt, if this institution fails in its goal of individual reform, there should be a clear revocation and banishment process for current nationals who violate the societal ethos.

## The Scorecard

From our thought experiment, we can create a scorecard to determine how strong a country's immigration policy is, according to our framework:

# Assessing U.S. Immigration Policy

Now that we have a scorecard, we can assess the current state of U.S. immigration policy.

::: blur
## 1. A Controlled Border

Let's investigate the state of the U.S. border.

The United States's border has two key sections: the US-Canada & US-Mexico borders:

While the US-Canada border is longer, the majority of recorded border encounters by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) occurs along the US-Mexico border:
